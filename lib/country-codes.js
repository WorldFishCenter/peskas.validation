/**
 * Canonical country codes, and the Airtable spellings that map onto them.
 *
 * Country identifiers enter this system as free text typed into Airtable, and that text has
 * already been renamed once: the Airtable `countries` table and the `forms` table's
 * "Associated Countries" field now read **"Timor-Leste"**, while `surveys.country_id` in MongoDB
 * still holds **"Timor"** from an earlier sync. The next survey sync will rewrite it.
 *
 * A plain trim+lowercase would turn that rename into four simultaneous breakages, because three
 * derived vocabularies key off the result:
 *   - `COUNTRY_METADATA` in the frontend is keyed `timor` → flag and name would disappear
 *   - `districts.country_id` is `timor` → the district filter would match nothing
 *   - a `countries` row would no longer match its own surveys
 *   - the PeSKAS download API would receive `timor-leste`
 *
 * Mapping aliases onto one canonical code makes such a rename a non-event. Unknown values fall
 * through as trim+lowercase, so onboarding a genuinely new country needs no code change — only
 * a country that acquires a *second* spelling needs an entry here.
 *
 * Keep this in sync with `src/utils/countryMetadata.ts`, which needs the same table in the
 * browser bundle (the frontend cannot import from `lib/`).
 *
 * @module lib/country-codes
