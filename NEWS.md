# Management Platform 2.9.0

A maintenance release: a few fixes on screens you use daily, and a large internal tidy-up that
leaves the portal safer to change.

## Fixed

- **Enumerator performance: filtered figures no longer fall back to all-time totals.** With a date
  range applied, an enumerator with no submissions in that range was shown their lifetime count
  instead of zero, so a quiet period could read as a busy one. They now show zero and drop out of
  the charts, as they always should have.

- **Alert code definitions are now scoped to your surveys.** Any signed-in user could read the
  alert-code configuration of any survey, including surveys in countries they have no access to.

- **Data download: choosing several forms returns all of them.** An administrator requesting more
  than one form received data from only the first, with nothing to say the rest had been dropped.
  The download screen selects one form at a time, so this affected direct API use rather than
  anything you could do from the page.

- **The enumerator picker no longer depends on your language.** It matched names against the
  translated word for "Unknown", so in Portuguese and Swahili it could have hidden a real
  enumerator from the dropdown. No one was affected.

## Notes

- Internal: all 29 API endpoints now share one wrapper for authentication, permissions, method
  checks and error handling, and the survey-permission rules live in one place covered by
  automated checks (`npm test`, now five). A few hundred lines of duplicated and unused code were
  removed. None of this changes how the portal looks or behaves.

# Management Platform 2.8.0

Peskas users can now write to the team without leaving the portal.

## New Features

- **Send feedback or ask for help, from any page.** The avatar menu at the top right has a new
  entry that opens a form in place — no email client, no separate website, no new tab. It reaches
  the Peskas team directly, and a notification goes out the moment something is submitted.

  The form covers the **whole system**, not only this portal: the public country dashboards, the
  Tracks app, the open data exports, and the validation, enumerator performance, data download and
  Data Explorer screens here. Report a figure that looks wrong, ask what a column means, ask for
  help with validation work, propose a new feature, or propose adding or changing a quality flag.
  Questions are as welcome as bug reports, and you can write in English, Portuguese or Swahili.

- **The form already knows who you are.** Your name is filled in from your session, and so is your
  country when your account is scoped to a single one — those questions are then hidden, so there
  is less to fill in before you can say what you came to say. Anything the portal cannot determine
  is left for you to answer rather than guessed: administrators and users working across several
  countries pick their own, and a country the portal does not recognise is never stamped onto your
  message.

## Notes

- Only a one-line summary and the details are required. Everything else — what kind of message it
  is, which part of Peskas it concerns, how much it is holding you up, your role, organisation and
  email — is optional, and the flag question appears only when you say your message is about a
  quality flag.
- Screenshots and files can be attached, and they travel with the message as real attachments.
- The feedback entry only appears once a form is configured, so the menu can never point at
  something that is not there.

# Management Platform 2.7.0

A performance and reliability release. The two heaviest screens now move a fraction of the data
they did, one survey that crashed the validation table works, and the enumerator dashboard no
longer counts a person who does not exist.

## Fixed

- **Fixed: opening the validation table on the Zanzibar Fish Catch Survey crashed the page**
  - Problem: none of that survey's 31,387 submissions carries a submission date. The code that
    works out the date-picker range assumed at least one did, and threw as soon as the rows
    loaded. One user has that survey as their only one, so the screen was unusable for them.
  - Solution: the range is empty when no submission is dated, and the date filter stays inactive
    instead of hiding every row. A test covers the case.

- **Fixed: the enumerator dashboard ranked an enumerator called "undefined"**
  - Problem: rows whose enumerator could not be identified are written with the text
    `"undefined"`. The dashboard filtered out `"Unknown"`, which never occurs, and so treated
    4,479 Kenya submissions and 382 Mozambique ones as the work of a single person.
  - Solution: placeholder enumerators are excluded where the data is read, so they cannot reach
    any chart.

- **Fixed: submissions awaiting validation showed a raw label.** Surveys the pipeline has not
  validated yet carry the status `not_validated`, which had no translation and no entry in the
  status filter. It now reads "Not Validated" in all three languages, and the filter offers
  whichever statuses the loaded survey actually contains rather than a fixed pair.

## Performance

- **The two main screens transfer 94% and 50% less data.** Measured against the largest survey
  (Mozambique SSF-CD, ~52,000 submissions):

  | Screen | Before | After |
  |---|---:|---:|
  | Enumerator Performance | 12.9 MB, 4.2 s | 0.68 MB, 1.0 s |
  | Validation table | 19.5 MB, 6.0 s | 0.01 MB, 0.6 s |

  The enumerator dashboard now asks the database for the counts it draws instead of downloading
  every submission and counting them in the browser.

- **The validation table loads one page at a time.** It used to download every submission in the
  survey — all 51,912 of them on Mozambique SSF-CD — and then show ten. Turning a page, sorting a
  column, searching or changing a filter now asks the database for exactly the rows being shown,
  so the screen opens in well under a second whatever the survey's size, and stays that way as
  the data grows.

  Two things behave differently as a result. The **search box** matches the start of a submission
  ID or an enumerator name across the whole survey, rather than fuzzily matching anything on
  screen; it waits a moment after you stop typing before searching. And the **date pickers start
  empty** rather than pre-filled with the survey's first and last day — the range they allow still
  shows what the survey covers, but an empty box now honestly means "no date filter".

- **Every request was making a spare round-trip to the database** to health-check a connection the
  driver already monitors. Removed.

- **Twenty-two missing database indexes were created.** Three collections — including one with
  31,387 documents — had none beyond the default, so sorting them was done in memory.
  `npm run ensure:indexes` re-checks and is safe to re-run.

## Housekeeping

- Sorting and filtering the validation table no longer copies all 52,000 rows on every keystroke.
- The submission detail panel no longer has a Vessel or Catch # row. The data pipeline has not
  written either field for any of the 118,466 submissions on record, so neither has ever
  appeared; they are gone rather than sitting there permanently blank.
- Removed roughly 700 lines of code with no callers, including three unused dependencies and the
  client functions left behind when user editing moved to Airtable.
- The backend is now type-checked (`api/`, `lib/`, `server/`), which found an audit-log category
  that eight endpoints wrote but the type did not allow.
- Moved to ESLint 9. Its stricter defaults surfaced five places where an error was rethrown with
  the original cause discarded.
- `npm run sync:all` referenced a script that was never committed, so it failed in a fresh clone.

# Management Platform 2.6.0

A maintenance release with no new screens. It closes a set of security holes, fixes several
features that had never actually worked, and pays off the accumulated code debt that was hiding
them.

## Security

- **Fixed: the password reset form could be used to take over an account** (critical)
  - Problem: the reset endpoint passed the token from the request straight into the database query
    without checking it was a string. A crafted request could therefore match **the first account
    holding any reset token** and overwrite its password. Combined with the account-disclosure
    issue below, an attacker could trigger a reset for a known administrator and then claim it.
  - Solution: reset tokens are now validated for shape (64 hexadecimal characters) before any
    lookup, by both endpoints that accept one. A missing expiry date is now treated as expired
    rather than as never expiring.

- **Fixed: the password reset form revealed whether an account existed**
  - Problem: it returned different messages for "no such user", "user has no email on file" and
    success, and rate-limited only real accounts — so it could be used to confirm which usernames
    and email addresses are valid.
  - Solution: every outcome now returns the same message. The real reason is written to the server
    log only.

- **Fixed: any signed-in user could change validation status on any survey** (critical)
  - Problem: both endpoints that record a validation status took the survey id from the request and
    checked only that it wasn't empty. A user could change statuses on surveys they have no access
    to, and could cause an entirely new collection to be created on first write. The KoboToolbox
    endpoint had no authorisation check at all, and its error messages disclosed survey names and
    configuration for surveys the caller cannot see.
  - Solution: both endpoints check the survey against the caller's permissions before writing, and
    both now return the same neutral message. Writing to an unknown submission is an honest "not
    found" rather than a silent insert.

- **Fixed: deactivating a user did nothing for up to seven days**
  - Problem: login refused disabled accounts, but every other request only checked the sign-in
    token — which lasts seven days. A deactivated user kept working until it expired.
  - Solution: every authenticated request now checks the account is still active.

- **Fixed: three secrets failed open when unset.** The signing key for sign-in tokens fell back to a
  value published in the source code, meaning anyone who could read the repository could mint an
  administrator session. Two sync endpoints accepted any caller when their secret was unconfigured.
  All three now refuse rather than allow, and signature comparisons are timing-safe.

- **Added: brute-force protection on login.** Ten failed attempts for a username within fifteen
  minutes returns "too many attempts". Deliberately keyed on the username rather than the network
  address, because field offices share an outbound address and an address-based limit would lock
  out a whole office when one person mistypes. Only failures count, a successful sign-in clears the
  counter, and the limiter is checked before any database or password work so a flood is cheap to
  reject.

- **Fixed: password length was unbounded on four endpoints**, which made password hashing an
  inexpensive way to exhaust the server. All of them now apply the same 8–200 character rule that
  login already used.

- **Fixed: the portal trusted every `*.vercel.app` site as same-origin**, so anyone could deploy a
  site to that domain and be treated as trusted. Now scoped to this project's own deployments plus
  explicitly configured domains.

- **Fixed: the admin screens had no role check in the interface.** The API always rejected
  non-administrators, so nothing was exposed, but the pages themselves could be opened by typing
  the URL. They now redirect.

## Bug Fixes

- **Fixed: validation status changes were never saved to the database** (critical)
  - Problem: the external data pipeline stores submission ids as **numbers**, while the portal
    received them from the page address as **text**. The database does not match across those two
    types, so the update matched nothing — and because the endpoint was set to "insert if missing",
    it quietly created a throwaway record instead and reported success. Status changes appeared to
    work only because the portal also pushes them to KoboToolbox, and the next pipeline run copied
    the real value back.
  - Solution: the lookup now matches either form. The KoboToolbox update is also sent **first**, so
    a failure there no longer leaves the two systems disagreeing.

- **Fixed: three settings saved correctly but reported an error.** Changing your language,
  changing a user's survey permissions, and editing a country all wrote to the database and then
  returned "not found". Caused by a database driver upgrade that changed the shape of the response.

- **Fixed: non-administrators saw an empty country list**, survey counts always showed zero, and
  the "you cannot delete a country that still has surveys" guard never fired — all because the code
  read a field that does not exist on survey records.

- **Fixed: viewing, editing or deleting any country returned "not found".** The lookup lowercased
  the country code before searching, but the stored codes are capitalised. Both sides are now
  normalised, so the casing on either no longer matters.

- **Fixed: an administrator with specific surveys assigned saw every survey.** There were five
  separate implementations of "which surveys can this user see" and they disagreed. There is now
  one.

- **Fixed: your language preference was never saved.** Four independent faults stacked on the one
  feature — the wrong address in the browser, the route missing from the local server, the
  server reporting an error on success, and the page hiding the failure.

## New Features

- **Countries are now synced from Airtable** (`npm run sync:countries`, and a step in the scheduled
  sync). Airtable was already the source of truth for users, surveys and districts, but not
  countries — the list had been frozen since January 2026, which is why a newly added country never
  appeared in the portal. Only countries with at least one linked form are synced, and the sync
  never deletes: a country in the database but not in Airtable is reported and left alone, because
  removing one would strip access from every user holding its surveys.

- **A country renamed in Airtable no longer breaks the portal.** Alternative spellings of the same
  country (for example "Timor" and "Timor-Leste") now resolve to a single internal code, so renaming
  a cell in the spreadsheet no longer silently detaches a country from its districts, its flag and
  its download data.

- **The Audit Log now covers administrative actions** — creating, updating and deleting users and
  countries, changing permissions, and administrator-initiated password resets. Updates record the
  **names of the fields that changed**, never the values, so a password never reaches the log.

## Improvements

- **The Audit Log reads properly.** Administrative events now have friendly names in all three
  languages instead of raw internal identifiers, are filterable as their own category, and show
  who was acted on together with the fields that changed. Data Explorer loads — the single most
  frequent event in the log — were also unnamed and now show their full filter details, matching
  how download events already displayed.

- **Missing country records are no longer silent.** When a user holds surveys in a country that has
  no matching record, the server now says so by name instead of the country simply vanishing from
  the interface.

- **Error messages from the server now reach the screen.** Thirteen places built their own error
  text and produced "[object Object]" for a whole class of gateway error. They all now use one
  shared helper.

- **The portal starts faster, especially on a slow connection.** Every visitor used to download all
  seven screens before anything appeared — including the charting library behind Enumerator
  Performance and the whole Data Explorer, even to reach the sign-in page. Each screen is now
  fetched the first time it is opened, cutting what loads up front by roughly a third. The charting
  library alone, the single largest piece, no longer loads at all for anyone who does not open
  Enumerator Performance. If a screen is requested moments after a new version is deployed, the
  page refreshes itself once to pick up the current files rather than showing an error.

## Infrastructure

- **Tabler is now bundled with the application instead of loaded from a public CDN.** The portal is
  used from field offices on unreliable connections, where a third-party CDN was one more thing that
  had to be reachable before the interface would render at all. The stylesheet and its JavaScript
  now ship as part of the build.

- **Removed a dead sync subsystem.** Scheduled Airtable syncing moved to GitHub Actions in an
  earlier release, but six modules from the previous approach were still present — including two
  endpoints that could never complete, because they started a background process that the hosting
  platform stops the moment a response is sent. All six had no callers and were removed. The three
  working sync paths are unchanged: the daily scheduled run, manual dispatch, and
  `POST /api/admin/sync-users`.

- **Fixed: new sync scripts would have been missing from CI.** A `.gitignore` rule excluded the
  `scripts/` directory itself, which meant the exceptions meant to re-include the four scripts CI
  runs were inert. Any newly added script would have been silently absent and the scheduled sync
  would have failed on a missing file.

- **Rate limiting is now general-purpose and bounded.** Previously specific to password resets, with
  no index and no expiry — every counter ever written was kept forever and every check scanned the
  whole collection. Now indexed, with a seven-day expiry.

- **The local development server matches production.** A route was mounted under the wrong spelling
  and four endpoints were missing entirely, so features worked in production and returned "not
  found" locally. The server's endpoint listing is now derived from what actually mounted, so it
  cannot drift again. A stale second copy of the database driver, three major versions behind, was
  also removed from `server/` — it was being resolved ahead of the current one.

- **Audit log indexes are created in one place.** They were declared twice with different retention
  rules, so how long events were kept depended on which path ran first.

- **Every known vulnerable dependency has been updated.** The project's third-party libraries had
  accumulated 127 published security advisories, three of them rated critical. Most were resolved
  simply by taking the current release of libraries the project already depended on — the HTTP
  client, the router, the web server and the email client. Two build tools, Vite and the TypeScript
  linter, had to move up a major version because their affected releases were never patched on the
  older line; neither ships in the product, both are used only to build and check it. A further
  forty advisories came from a leftover dependency list for the old development server, which this
  release removes. No known advisories remain.

## Code Quality

- **ESLint had never actually run.** The React hooks plugin was installed but not enabled, and the
  TypeScript rules were declared without being switched on — so the entire ruleset was inert and
  `npm run lint` had been failing outright. With the rules enabled, eight genuine React dependency
  bugs surfaced and were fixed, including two cases where a component held onto its very first
  render's functions forever.

- **`any` is gone from the codebase — 61 occurrences to zero**, and the lint gate now runs at
  `--max-warnings 0`, so a new one fails the build. About a third disappeared with the dead code
  that contained it; the rest was replaced with types checked against what the endpoints actually
  return rather than what they were assumed to return. Two long-standing inaccuracies turned up
  that way: a field that had never existed under the name the code used, and a field marked
  required that is absent from most records.

- **Duplication consolidated.** One definition each for the survey type, the quality-score
  calculation, the alert tally, and the download query builder — where previously there were two to
  four, quietly able to disagree. Six of the nine duplicates were resolved by deleting a copy that
  had no callers at all, including a whole translation file whose contents nothing had ever read.

- **Dead code removed** — two unreachable components, two unused data-processing functions, an
  authentication scheme whose header no endpoint has ever read, and a database index on a field that
  never exists.

- **Survey identifiers are validated where the collection name is built**, rather than relying on
  every caller to do it. Confirmed against production first: every existing survey identifier and
  every existing collection satisfies the rule.

# Management Platform 2.5.0

## New Features

- **Data Explorer — learn to work with your own data, in the browser**
  - A new **Data Explorer** tab presents a catalog of short, interactive R lessons (inspired by [fhdsl/data_snacks](https://github.com/fhdsl/data_snacks)), written for people who have never written code
  - Lessons run **R entirely inside your browser** — nothing to install, and your data never leaves the page — via the [quarto-live](https://github.com/r-wasm/quarto-live) extension and [webR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/) (R 4.6, WebAssembly)
  - Every lesson works on **your own landings data**, under exactly the same permissions as the Data Download tab. Your records are fetched automatically when the page opens, and a panel tells you how many loaded, with a button to load them again
  - **Five lessons, in order**, each about 10–20 minutes:
    1. *Welcome — your first look at the data* — what R is, and how to press **Run**
    2. *Getting to know your data* — what one row means, how rows group into trips, and what each column holds
    3. *Find what you need* — `distinct()`, `filter()`, `select()`, the pipe `|>`, and how to read an error message instead of fearing it
    4. *Add it up* — `group_by()` and `summarise()`: totals and averages per district, gear or species
    5. *See it as a picture* — turning a table of totals into a bar chart you can put in a report
  - Plus a printable **recipe card** with every command from the course on one page
  - Lessons are **practice-first**: a recap question opens each one, predict-then-run questions come before the answer, and fill-in-the-blank exercises have hints and worked solutions. Every lesson repeats that **nothing can be broken**
  - Available from the **Data Tools** menu; lesson titles and descriptions are translated into English, Portuguese and Swahili

## Improvements

- **The portal is now the "Management Platform"**
  - Renamed throughout the interface, documentation and emails, from "Validation Portal" — the platform now covers validation, performance tracking, download and exploration, so the old name described only a part of it

- **Compacter navigation with grouped menus**
  - Related tabs are now consolidated into Tabler dropdown menus to reduce navbar clutter
  - **Validation** groups *Submissions* and *Enumerator Performance*
  - **Data Tools** groups *Data Download* and *Data Explorer*
  - The parent menu highlights while you are on any of its pages; available in all three languages (English, Portuguese, Swahili)

## Infrastructure

- **Lesson pipeline**: lessons are authored as Quarto `.qmd` files in `data-explorer/`, rendered to static HTML (`npm run render:lessons`) committed under `public/data-explorer/lessons/`, and served by Vercel. Cross-origin isolation headers (COOP + COEP `credentialless`) are scoped to `/data-explorer/lessons/*` only, so the rest of the app is unaffected while webR gets `SharedArrayBuffer`.
- **New endpoint** `GET /api/data-download/explorer-data`: returns a capped (5,000-row), permission-filtered landings JSON array (quarto-live auto-converts it to an R data.frame in webR) for the in-browser R runtime, reusing the same permission gate as the data export.
- **Shared lesson parts**: the data panel, example table, field dictionary and standard notices are single include files (`data-explorer/_*.qmd`), so a definition cannot say one thing in a lesson and another on the recipe card. Presentation lives in one stylesheet (`data-explorer/lesson.css`) rather than per-lesson `<style>` blocks.
- **Technical plumbing is hidden from learners**: the fetch, the data-frame conversion and package loading run in cells marked `include: false`, so every code box a learner can see contains only R the lesson actually explains.
- **Authoring guide** ([docs/LESSON_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md](docs/LESSON_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md)) documents the audience, the writing rules, the lesson skeleton and a pre-publish checklist.

# Management Platform 2.4.0

## Bug Fixes

- **Fixed: Data Download could return data from the wrong forms** (critical)
  - Problem: Downloads and previews were filtered by **country only** — the survey (form) you selected had no effect on the data returned. A user assigned to specific forms could receive data from *other* forms in the same country, and users with forms in more than one country only ever saw their first country's data. The survey selector in the filters was effectively decorative.
  - Solution: Every download and preview is now strictly scoped to the surveys you are permitted to access. Each request is pinned to one of your forms, with its country derived from the form itself. Data from forms you are not assigned to can no longer appear in your results.

## New Features

- **Download all of your forms at once**
  - If you have access to several forms and leave the survey selector on **All forms**, the portal now fetches each form and merges them into a single preview and CSV — correctly, even when your forms span multiple countries.

## Improvements

- **Clearer Data Download filters**
  - **All forms** is now an explicit, visually distinct option (green icon and "Default" badge) — you can finally return to "all forms" after picking a specific one.
  - The **Administrative Area** filter now appears only after you choose a specific survey, following a clear Country → Survey → Area flow, with a hint explaining how to reveal it.
  - Added scannable icons to each filter and a friendlier message when your account has no surveys assigned.
  - Permission problems (e.g. requesting a survey or area you can't access) now return a clear message instead of a generic error.

# Management Platform 2.3.0

## New Features

- **Audit Log for administrators**
  - A new Audit Log page is available under the Admin section
  - Records every security-sensitive action: logins (success and failure), validation status changes, and data preview/export requests
  - Shows who did what, when, from which IP address, and with what parameters
  - Filterable by username, event category, and date range
  - Sortable columns; paginates with configurable page size (50 / 100 / 200)
  - Download events show full filter details as colored badges (country, status, scope, taxon, district, survey)
  - Events are automatically purged after 90 days

## Infrastructure

- **Removed legacy development server** (`server/index.js`, ~1960 lines)
  - The local development server now uses `server/dev.js`, which mounts the same serverless handlers used in production
  - Eliminates the risk of local and production behavior diverging for any endpoint

## Security

- **Audit events are now guaranteed to be written**
  - Previously, audit log writes happened after the HTTP response was sent; in a serverless environment this means they were silently dropped
  - All audit writes now complete before the response is returned

# Management Platform 2.2.0

## Performance Improvements

- **Enumerator Performance dashboard now loads per survey**
  - Previously loaded data from all surveys simultaneously, causing slow loads and potential crashes for admin users with many surveys
  - Now uses the same per-survey loading pattern as the Validation Table — fast regardless of the number of surveys accessible

## New Features

- **Survey selection is remembered when switching tabs**
  - Selecting a survey on the Validation Table tab now carries over when you navigate to the Enumerator Performance tab, and vice versa
  - No more re-selecting your survey every time you switch views

## Code Quality

- **Simplified state management in Enumerator Performance**
  - Replaced a 3-step data pipeline (useMemo → useEffect → state → useEffect → state) with direct derived values using `useMemo`
  - Eliminates extra render cycles on date filter changes

---

# Management Platform 2.1.0

## Bug Fixes

- **Fixed: React crash when data preview times out**
  - Problem: When the PeSKAS API was slow to respond, Vercel returned a gateway error containing an object `{code, message}` instead of a plain text message. This object was rendered directly in the UI, crashing the page.
  - Solution: The portal now correctly extracts a readable message from any error format, including Vercel gateway errors.

- **Fixed: Admin users crashing the validation table**
  - Problem: Admin users have access to all active surveys. The portal was trying to load all surveys simultaneously, which could exceed the response size limit and cause a crash with "Cannot read properties of undefined".
  - Solution: Admin users are now required to select a survey before data loads, consistent with how the development environment already worked.

## Performance Improvements

- **Faster validation table for all users**
  - The submissions API now fetches only the fields needed by the table (previously fetching all document fields including internal configuration data)
  - Results are sorted at the database level instead of in memory

- **Reduced timeout risk for data preview and export**
  - Extended the server timeout for data download functions from 10 to 30 seconds, providing more headroom for large or slow PeSKAS API responses

## Reliability Improvements

- **PeSKAS API no longer times out on first load**
  - The PeSKAS API (which powers the data download feature) now stays warm at all times — no more slow first requests after periods of inactivity
  - Repeated preview requests for the same filters are now served from cache

## Infrastructure

- **Consistent behavior across all environments**
  - The production API and the local development server now behave identically for the submissions endpoint (pagination, survey selection, permissions, sorting)

---

# Management Platform 2.0.0

## What's New

This release focuses on making the data synchronization from Airtable more reliable, automated, and safe. We've transformed the sync system from basic (3/10) to production-ready (8/10).

## Key Improvements

### Reliability & Data Safety

- **Automatic Column Name Detection**
  - The system now automatically detects when Airtable column names change
  - Shows clear error messages telling you exactly which columns need updating
  - Prevents data from being corrupted when column names don't match
  - Example: If you rename "Form ID" to "asset" in Airtable, the system will catch this before syncing

- **Backup & Recovery System**
  - Every sync now creates a backup before making changes
  - If something goes wrong, the system automatically restores from backup
  - Your data is never left in a broken state
  - Like having an "undo" button for data synchronization

- **Simplified Codebase**
  - Reduced duplicate code by 44%
  - Easier to maintain and fix issues
  - Three separate implementations combined into one reliable version

### Automation

- **Daily Automatic Syncs**
  - Data syncs automatically every day at 2 AM UTC
  - No need to remember to run syncs manually
  - Keeps portal data fresh without intervention

- **Real-Time Updates (Optional)**
  - Can trigger instant syncs when you change data in Airtable
  - Uses Airtable webhooks for immediate updates
  - Optional feature - daily syncs work without this

- **Smart Sync Ordering**
  - System automatically syncs in the correct order (Districts → Surveys → Users)
  - Prevents errors from missing dependencies
  - One command syncs everything in the right sequence

### Monitoring & Tracking

- **Complete Sync History**
  - Every sync operation is logged with full details
  - Track what changed, when, and who triggered it
  - See exactly how many records were created, updated, or skipped
  - Easy to review past syncs and troubleshoot issues

- **Error Prevention**
  - System prevents multiple syncs from running at the same time
  - Avoids data conflicts and corruption
  - Automatically handles connection issues with retry logic
  - Respects Airtable's rate limits to avoid quota errors

## Bug Fixes

- **Fixed: "All Districts" Filter**
  - Problem: When selecting "all districts" in data download, you only got data from one district
  - Solution: Now correctly returns data from all districts when "all districts" is selected
  - Both administrators and regular users can now download data from all districts at once

- **Fixed: Airtable Column Name Changes**
  - Problem: When Airtable columns were renamed, syncs would fail silently
  - Solution: System now detects mismatches and shows clear instructions on what to fix
  - Prevented a potential sync failure by catching "Form ID" → "asset" column rename

## What This Means for You

### Data Managers
- Your data is now protected with automatic backups
- Daily syncs happen automatically - one less thing to remember
- Clear history of all sync operations for auditing
- Immediate error messages if something needs attention

### Administrators
- Reduced maintenance burden with automated daily syncs
- Complete audit trail for compliance and troubleshooting
- Option to enable real-time syncs for instant updates
- Simple commands to run manual syncs when needed

# Management Platform 1.6.0

## New Features

- **PeSKAS API Data Download Integration**
  - Download landings data from PeSKAS database (api.peskas.org)
  - Permission-based filtering by country and GAUL codes
  - Preview-before-download UX pattern (20 rows preview + total count)
  - Filter options: country, GAUL Level 2, status, catch taxon, scope
  - Single-select UI for surveys and districts (matches API constraint)
  - CSV export with automatic sanitization and security hardening
  - Multi-language support (English, Portuguese, Swahili)

## Infrastructure Improvements

- **60-70% Faster Page Load Performance**
  - Unified metadata endpoint: 3 HTTP requests → 1 request (~900-1500ms → ~300-400ms)
  - Server-side pre-filtered data (countries, districts, surveys)
  - Single loading state instead of 3 independent states
  - Eliminated runtime Airtable dependency for districts

- **Districts Migration to MongoDB**
  - Migrated districts from runtime Airtable fetching to MongoDB `districts` collection
  - Created sync script `scripts/sync_districts_from_airtable.js` (follows user/survey pattern)
  - Added indexes: `code` (unique), `country_id`, `active`, compound indexes
  - Airtable now only used for periodic syncs (not runtime dependency)

- **Shared Permission Utilities**
  - NEW: `lib/filter-permissions.js` - Centralized permission filtering logic
  - Functions: `getAccessibleCountries()`, `getAccessibleSurveys()`, `getAccessibleDistricts()`, `applyDownloadPermissions()`
  - Removed ~200 lines of duplicated code across endpoints
  - Single source of truth for permission filtering

## Security Improvements

- **Input Validation for External API**
  - Validates all PeSKAS API parameters before external calls
  - Regex patterns: country, status, scope, catch_taxon, survey_id, gaul_2
  - Whitelist validation for status and scope parameters
  - Prevents injection attacks and ensures data integrity

- **CSV Injection Prevention**
  - NEW: `sanitizeCSV()` function in lib/helpers.js
  - Detects dangerous characters: `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, `\t`, `\r`
  - Prepends single quote to cells starting with dangerous characters
  - Prevents formula injection in Excel/Google Sheets

- **Debug Logging Removal**
  - Removed console.log/console.warn from production code
  - Prevents sensitive data exposure in browser console
  - Cleaner production deployment

## Bug Fixes

- **Country Case Mismatch**
  - Fixed: Database has `country_id: "Zanzibar"` but code lowercased to `"zanzibar"` before querying
  - Impact: Survey/GAUL filtering returned empty arrays (no matches)
  - Solution: Preserve original case for MongoDB queries, lowercase only for external API

- **Scope Filter Defaulting Incorrectly**
  - Fixed: `scope = 'trip_info'` in parameter destructuring defaulted even when empty
  - Impact: Users couldn't get "all data" by leaving scope empty
  - Solution: Removed default value, only include if explicitly provided

- **Survey/GAUL Multi-Select Confusion**
  - Fixed: PeSKAS API doesn't support multiple survey IDs or GAUL codes
  - Impact: UI allowed multi-select but only first value was used (confusing UX)
  - Solution: Changed from checkboxes to radio buttons (single-select)
  - Updated translations to singular forms ("Survey" not "Surveys")

## UI/UX Improvements

- **Adaptive Layout**
  - Before preview: Centered single-column layout (filters only)
  - After preview: Two-column layout (filters left, preview right)
  - Filters become sticky sidebar when preview shown
  - More intuitive space utilization
